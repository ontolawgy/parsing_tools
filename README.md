parsing_tools
=============

These are some simple tools for parsing legal materials. 

Some of them work well, and some less well. 

You use all of them at your own risk. 

Their names and purpose should be self-evident. I have tried to rationally
name them and comment throughout where what I am trying to do is not
necessarily clear. It might not be objectively "good" code (well, hopefully it
is), but if it's not, hopefully the comments make the intent clear, and fixing
it should be easier.
